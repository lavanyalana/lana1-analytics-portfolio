Instagram User Analytics - MySQL

Analyzing User Engagement and Behavior on Instagram

Project Overview

In today's digital age, social media analytics plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, optimizing marketing campaigns, and detecting abnormal activity. This project focuses on analyzing Instagram data to uncover patterns in user interactions, engagement, and behavior. By extracting and analyzing data from key tables in the database, I derived actionable insights that can help improve campaign scheduling, identify potential fake accounts, and determine the most engaging hashtags.

The analysis is built on SQL fundamentals, including complex JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries to derive valuable insights from Instagram user data.

Key Skills & Tools Used

- SQL Fundamentals – Data extraction, manipulation, and aggregation
- Data Analysis – User behavior analysis, engagement pattern identification, hashtag analysis
- Database Structure Understanding – Proficient with JOIN operations and query optimization
- Insights Extraction – Identifying user behavior trends and campaign optimization strategies

  Approach & Methodology

  1. Data Extraction & Understanding:
 
Familiarized myself with the structure of the database, focusing on key tables:

-users – Registered user data
-photos – Photos uploaded by users
-tags – Hashtags associated with photos
-photos_tags – Links between photos and hashtags
-likes – Likes on photos
-comments – User comments on photos
-follows – Follow relationships between users

2. Key SQL Queries for Analysis:

User Engagement Patterns:

-Used JOINs to connect users, photos, and interactions (likes, comments, follows)
-Aggregated the data with COUNT() and GROUP BY to determine average engagement per user

Hashtag Popularity:

-Extracted top hashtags by linking photos and tags using JOIN
-Identified the most popular hashtags using GROUP BY and COUNT()

Optimal Campaign Scheduling:

-Analyzed user registration activity to determine the best days for campaigns (using HAVING for specific days)

Identifying Fake Accounts:

-Used engagement patterns and activity data to detect outliers or suspicious user behavior that may indicate bot or fake accounts

3. Execution & Data Interpretation:

-Ran complex queries with subqueries, JOINs, and aggregation functions (COUNT(), GROUP BY, HAVING) to uncover hidden insights from the data
-Interpreted query results to derive actionable insights such as peak engagement times, popular hashtags, and user behavior patterns

Insights & Impact

-  Best Campaign Scheduling: Identified the optimal days for posting based on user registration and engagement trends, ensuring campaigns reach the most active users.
-  Top Hashtags: Determined the most popular hashtags, allowing marketers to target trending topics for greater visibility and engagement.
-  Identifying Fake Accounts: Detected users with abnormal engagement patterns, potentially indicating fake or bot accounts, ensuring the integrity of Instagram’s user data.
-  Improved User Understanding: Unveiled trends in user behavior, helping businesses understand their audience's preferences and activity patterns.
