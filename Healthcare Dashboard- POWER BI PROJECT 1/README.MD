# Healthcare Dashboard - Power BI

## Transforming Healthcare Data into Actionable Insights

## Project Overview
In the fast-paced healthcare industry, efficient patient management is crucial. This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of inpatient and outpatient trends, helping stakeholders analyze wait times, case types, and patient volume to optimize hospital operations.I built this dashboard from raw multiple Excel files and transformed them into a powerful interactive visualization, offering both summary insights and in-depth analysis of patient data.

## Key Skills & Tools Used
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation – Power Query (Merging, Appending, Shaping Data)
2. Data Modeling – Structuring inpatient & outpatient records
4. Data Visualization – Interactive dashboards, charts, and slicers in Power BI
5. Analytics & Insights – Trends in patient wait times, case types, and age distribution
6. Design & User Experience – Custom theme (Blue & Pink), PowerPoint-designed background

## Approach & Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation:
Combined 4 inpatient & 4 outpatient Excel files into a single dataset
Used Power Query to transform and append inpatient & outpatient tables

### 2. Dashboard Development:
### Summary Page:
- Latest & Previous Month Wait List with key filters (Case Type, Speciality)
- Age Profile & Time Band Analysis (Column Chart – Avg/Median Wait List)
- Patient Volume Trends (Line Chart – Inpatient & Outpatient Over Time)
- Key Metrics Cards (Avg/Median Wait List per Case Type)

### Detailed View Page:
- Matrix Table (In-depth inpatient & outpatient records by Archive Date & Case Type)
- Slicers for Dynamic Filtering (Improved user interactivity)

## 3. Design & Interactivity:

Custom Blue-Pink Theme (Designed in PowerPoint) for a clean and professional look
Interactive filters, slicers, and visuals for a seamless user experience

## Insights & Impact
1. Improved Hospital Planning – Identifies high wait-time cases & trends over months
2. Better Resource Allocation – Age & Case Type analysis helps in decision-making
3. Real-time Decision Making – Interactive filters allow deep diving into patient data
